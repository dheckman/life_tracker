Do:

Build an application called "life_tracker" using Rails scaffolding. This application should let you add, edit, and update schools you've attended and life events you have had. 

Schools have to have a name, beginning year, and ending year. 

Life events have to have a title and year (or date, your choice) they happened. They can have a description, limited to 140 characters.

**Bonus:** Schools' beginning year cannot be greater than their ending year.

**Bonus:** Create a new controller called HomeController that shows one view on the root of the site and links to your schools and life events.
